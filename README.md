# MLOps Continuous Integration for ML

## Overview

This project implements a continuous integration (CI) pipeline for a machine learning (ML) project using MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) practices. MLOps is a set of practices that aims to streamline and automate the process of deploying and managing machine learning models in production.

## Business Issue

Many businesses today rely on machine learning models to make data-driven decisions and improve various aspects of their operations. However, deploying and managing these models in production can be challenging due to several factors:

- **Model Drift**: Over time, the data distribution in production environments may change, leading to a degradation in model performance.
- **Scalability**: As the number of models and their complexity increase, managing them manually becomes impractical.
- **Reproducibility**: It's essential to ensure that model training and deployment processes are reproducible and well-documented.
- **Compliance and Governance**: Businesses need to ensure that deployed models comply with regulatory requirements and ethical standards.

## Solution

To address these challenges, this project implements a CI pipeline using MLOps practices. The pipeline automates the end-to-end process of training machine learning models, evaluating model performance, and generating reports. By automating these tasks, businesses can:

- **Improve Efficiency**: Automating model deployment and management processes saves time and resources.
- **Ensure Consistency**: Automated pipelines ensure that all models are trained, evaluated, and deployed using the same standardized process.
- **Facilitate Collaboration**: MLOps practices encourage collaboration between data scientists, developers, and operations teams, leading to better outcomes.
- **Enhance Governance**: Automated pipelines enable better tracking and auditing of model changes, improving compliance and governance.

## Use Cases

This CI pipeline is useful in the following scenarios:

- **Model Development**: During the development phase, the pipeline helps data scientists iterate quickly by automating model training and evaluation tasks.
- **Model Deployment**: In production, the pipeline ensures that models are deployed consistently and reliably, reducing the risk of errors and downtime.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance**: The pipeline can be extended to include monitoring and maintenance tasks, such as detecting model drift and retraining models as needed.
